# SOC-SIEM-HOMELAD-Attack-Box-and-Defense
Project LAB:

Welcome to my 1st personal Security Operations Center (SOC) training lab project!
This repository documents how I set up a home lab to practice real‑world attack simulation and endpoint detection using tools Sliver (C2) and LimaCharlie (SIEM/EDR) — all running on virtual machines.

Project Overview

This lab isn’t theoretical — it’s hands‑on. I built it to:
Spin up a controlled cyber attack environment
Generate adversary traffic using Sliver
Collect, analyze, and respond to logs using LimaCharlie as the SIEM/EDR
Improve my threat detection and incident handling skills

All activity happens within virtual machines I manage, so nothing touches external networks without my control.
