# Project LAB:

Welcome to my 1st personal Security Operations Center (SOC) training lab project!
This repository documents how I set up a home lab to practice real‑world attack simulation and endpoint detection using tools Sliver (C2) and LimaCharlie (SIEM/EDR) — all running on virtual machines.

### <ins>Project Overview:</ins>

This lab isn’t theoretical — it’s hands‑on. I built it to:


- Spin up a controlled cyber attack environment

- Generate adversary traffic using Sliver

- Collect, analyze, and respond to logs using LimaCharlie as the SIEM/EDR

- Improve my threat detection and incident handling skills


All activity happens within virtual machines I manage, so nothing touches external networks without my control.

### <ins>Setup:</ins>


The first thing I did was set up both virtual machines for the lab. My attack machine is running Ubuntu Server, while the endpoint is a Windows 11 system. To make sure the lab runs properly and I can observe attacker behavior without interference, I disabled Microsoft Defender along with other built‑in protections. On the Ubuntu machine, I installed Sliver as my main attack framework. On the Windows endpoint, I set up LimaCharlie to act as my EDR solution, deploying a sensor to the system and configuring it to ingest Sysmon logs for detailed visibility

### <ins>The Attacks and the Defense (Full Process Breakdown):</ins>


The next step in the lab is generating a payload using Sliver and deploying it to the Windows endpoint. Once the payload is executed on the host machine, it establishes a command‑and‑control session back to the attack server, allowing me to interact with the system and simulate attacker activity.

With an active session established between both machines, I can start interacting with the endpoint from the attack system. From there, I begin basic reconnaissance by checking user privileges, gathering host and system information, and identifying what security controls are in place on the machine.

On the Windows host, I can review LimaCharlie to observe the telemetry being generated by the attacker activity. From there, I’m able to identify the running payload and see the external IP address it’s communicating with.

I can also use LimaCharlie to submit the payload’s hash to VirusTotal for analysis. Since the payload was custom‑generated as part of the lab, it comes back clean with no detections, which is expected.

From the attack machine, I can then simulate a credential‑theft technique by dumping the LSASS process memory. On the defensive side, I use LimaCharlie to review the sensor data, analyze the resulting telemetry, and create detection rules to flag access to this sensitive process.

At this stage, I move beyond simple detection and start using LimaCharlie to actively prevent the attacks coming from the Sliver server. From the Ubuntu attack machine, I simulate ransomware‑like behavior by attempting to delete volume shadow copies on the Windows endpoint. I then review the resulting telemetry in LimaCharlie and write a rule that both detects and blocks this activity. Once the rule is in place, repeating the same attack from the Ubuntu machine is unsuccessful, demonstrating effective prevention rather than just visibility.
